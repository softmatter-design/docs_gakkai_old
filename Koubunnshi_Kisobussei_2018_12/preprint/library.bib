abstract = {The realization of an ideal polymer network that is free from heterogeneity is one of the ultimate goals in polymer science. Heterogeneity is known to be an inherent property of polymer networks. To realize an ideal polymer network, we need to develop methods to achieve a homogeneous network structure and to confirm the network homogeneity. This is a dilemma, as the former method needs to be verified by the latter method, while the latter method needs to be examined by the former method. To resolve this situation, a series of studies on polymer networks with well-defined properties is needed. We recently designed and fabricated novel Tetra-polyethyleneglycol (PEG) hydrogels. Characterization by small angle neutron scattering, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and tearing experiments indicates that Tetra-PEG gels have highly suppressed heterogeneity. In this review, we show a series of experimental results from Tetra-PEG gels and discuss the results in terms of network homogeneity. Finally, using Tetra-PEG gels as a model system, we examine models for predicting the elastic modulus of polymer gels and show that Tetra-PEG gels are useful as a model system for evaluating models that predict the physical properties of polymer networks.},

abstract = {The understanding of the physical properties of conventional hydrogels has been controversial because hydrogels inherently have a substantial amount of various heterogeneities in their structures. In this study, we focused on one of the simplest heterogeneities, heterogeneous distribution of strand length, and investigated its influence on physical properties. We prepared tetra-PEG gels with bimodal distribution in strand length (tetra-PEG bimodal gels) by combining tetra-PEG prepolymers with different molecular weights and measured the physical properties. The physical properties of tetra-PEG bimodal gels formed above the overlapping concentration of prepolymers were well described by the models for conventional tetra-PEG gels with the average polymerization degrees between cross-links. We conclude that the mechanical properties of hydrogels that have heterogeneous distribution in strand length can be predicted from those of hydrogels with the average strand length in the range tested in this study.},

@article{Ito2007,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: We have recently developed a novel type of gel called the slide-ring gel or topological gel that is different from physical and chemical gels by using the supramolecular architecture with topological characteristics. In this gel, polymer chains with bulky end groups exhibit neither covalently cross-links as in chemical gels nor attrac- tive interactions as in physical gels but are topologically interlocked by figure-of-eight cross-links. Hence, these cross- links can pass along the polymer chains freely to equalize the tension of the threading polymer chains similarly to pul- leys; this is called the pulley effect. The slide-ring gel is a new cross-linking concept for the polymer network as well as a real example of a slip-link model or sliding gel, which was previously considered only theoretically. In this study, we review the synthesis, structure, and mechanical properties of the slide-ring gels with freely movable cross-linking junc- tions based primarily on our recent studies. The pulley effect of the slide-ring gels has been recently confirmed by mechanical measurements, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS), etc. This concept can be applied to not only gels but also to a wide variety of polymeric materials without solvents.

We introduce a small (pseudo-) line crack in each network and numerically calculate the force distribution when the networks are (strongly) stretched in the direction perpendicular to the line crack. Even in highly deformed networks, we find that there exist strain-dependent scaling relations between the maximum stress (appearing at the crack tip) and the mesh size: the larger the mesh size, the smaller the stress concentration, and, thus, the stronger the network. Our finding might suggest a way of reinforcement of materials with voids under a given amount of solid.},

The method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints.

abstract = {Rheo-optical studies on viscoelasticity of amorphous polymers in the vicinity of the glass-to-rubber transition zone are reviewed. One of important progresses is a finding of the modified stress-optical rule, MSOR. The rule says that the stress has two molecular origins. One (R component) is due to the chain orientation like rubbery materials and the other (G component) is due to deformation of packing state of repeating units. The G component has common features for glass forming materials. The MSOR successfully explains many characteristic features of the viscoelasticity around the glass transition zone such as breakdown of time-temperature superposition principle. Another significance is that the MSOR provides a new method to analyze the viscoelasticity around the glass transition zone. The separation into the two origins gives better prospects on the relationship between viscoelasticity and the molecular structure. The method can be applied to other important issues including nonlinear viscoelasticity around the glass transition zone and sub-relaxations in the glassy zone.},

abstract = {The gelation mechanism and cross-link inhomogeneity of phenolic resins prepared via polycondensation of phenol and formaldehyde under acidic conditions were studied using small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering and 1H-pulse nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The solvent-swelling technique was applied for both measurements at the initial stage of gelation to enhance the local fluctuations of the cross-link density. The change in the static and dynamic structures obtained through observations of the X-ray scattering functions and the spin-spin relaxation functions, respectively, during the polycondensation reaction indicates the presence of two different mechanisms for the formation and growth of the inhomogeneity that depend on the amount of cross-linker. (i) When there is a stoichiometrically insufficient amount of the cross-linker, inhomogeneous domains with a loosely cross-linked network appear at the initial stage of gelation. The intradomain reactions become dominant in the growth of the inhomogeneous domain and the degree of cross-linking in the domain increases by bridging two unreacted sites in the network structure via the cross-linker. (ii) When there is a stoichiometric amount of the cross-linker, inhomogeneous domains with a tightly cross-linked network appear at the initial stage of gelation. The interdomain reactions become dominant in the growth of the domain and the size of the domain increases by incorporating new polymer chains into the domain via the cross-linker.},

abstract = {Double-network (DN) gels have drawn much attention as an innovative material having both high water content (ca. 90 wt{\%}) and high mechanical strength and toughness. DN gels are characterized by a special network structure consisting of two types of polymer components with opposite physical natures: the minor component is abundantly cross-linked polyelectrolytes (rigid skeleton) and the major component comprises of poorly cross-linked neutral polymers (ductile substance). The former and the latter components are referred to as the first network and the second network, respectively, since the synthesis should be done in this order to realize high mechanical strength. For DN gels synthesized under suitable conditions (choice of polymers, feed compositions, atmosphere for reaction, etc.), they possess hardness (elastic modulus of 0.1-1.0 MPa), strength (failure tensile nominal stress 1-10 MPa, strain 1000-2000{\%}; failure compressive nominal stress 20-60 MPa, strain 90-95{\%}), and toughness (tearing fracture energy of 100[similar]1000 J m-2). These excellent mechanical performances are comparable to that of rubbers and soft load-bearing bio-tissues. The mechanical behaviors of DN gels are inconsistent with general mechanisms that enhance the toughness of soft polymeric materials. Thus, DN gels present an interesting and challenging problem in polymer mechanics. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the toughening of DN gel is based on a local yielding mechanism, which has some common features with other brittle and ductile nano-composite materials, such as bones and dentins.},

abstract = {The author proposes a new concept with a new interface model for carbon black reinforcement of elastomer, based on stress analysis. The new model consists of double uncrosslinked polymer layers of different molecular mobility, the inner glassy hard (GH) layer, and the outer sticky hard (SH) layer surrounding a carbon particle. In this report, the most essential and fundamental three subjects in the carbon black reinforcement are discussed. Large stress increase with filler content and increasing strain amplitude results from the strong stress concentration generated around carbon particles and its transmission to the whole system. The great increase in tensile stress is only possible when the stress-hardened superstructure produced in the SH layer under large extension supports the large stress concentration. The super structure is the network of carbon particles interconnected by strands of oriented and extended molecules, together with a craze-like phenomenon forming numerous microvoids. Stress softening, called the Mullins effect, mainly results from the buckling of the strand of oriented molecules. Thus, the large and instant stress reduction takes place in unloading, in which the main load-bearing force is the entropic, contractile force of matrix crosslinked rubber. During long periods, the extended molecules in the uncrosslinked SH layer will considerably relax and return to their original entropic state. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc},

The intensity correlation functions (ICFs) were well fitted with the sum of single and stretched exponential function throughout the gelation process, indicating that the dynamics of the gelation process always had both a fast and slow modes. In addition, we compared the gelation process with that of Tetra-PEG hydrogel.

abstract = {Rubber elasticity, identified as the capacity to sustain very large deformations followed by complete recovery, is exhibited exclusively by polymeric substances consisting predominantly of long molecular chains. Moreover, it is manifested under suitable conditions by virtually all polymers so constituted. The molecular theory of rubber elasticity rests on the premise, now fully validated by experiments, that alterations of the configurations of the chains comprising the network account for the elastic free energy and for the stress arising from deformation. Early theories of rubber elasticity were propounded on the assumption that displacements of the junctions are affine in the macroscopic strain. James and Guth, avoiding this assumption, treated a phantom network consisting of Gaussian chains having otherwise no material properties. They showed (i) that the mean positions of the junctions in this hypothetical network are affine in the strain, and (ii) that fluctuations about these positions are invariant under strain. The corollary that the instantaneous distribution of the chain vectors cannot be affine in the strain escaped notice for many years. The copious interpenetration of chains that characterizes polymer networks should be expected to restrain the fluctuations of junctions embedded therein, but not to suppress them altogether. Moreover, the restraints on fluctuations should depend on the state of strain. Departures from phantom behavior consequently occur to a degree that depends on the strain. Formulation of a self-consistent theory based on this idea required recognition of the non-affine connection between the chain vector distribution function and the macroscopic strain in a real network, which may partake of characteristics of a phantom network in some degree. Postulation of domains of constraint affecting the equilibrium distribution of fluctuations of network junctions from their mean positions led to a theory that accounts for the observed relationship of stress to strain virtually throughout the ranges accessible to measurement. The theory establishes connections between network structure and elastic properties. All essential parameters are determined by the connectivity of the network, the number and functionality of its junctions, and inherent characteristics of the molecular chains comprising the network.},

abstract = {The kinetics of end crosslinking a linear polymer melt and the dynamics of the resulting network is studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Starting from equilibrated melts of linear chains of length ranging from 1/3N e to 3N e , where N e is the entanglement length, tetrafunctional crosslinkers are attached to a fraction x of the chain ends. When a free end comes within a short capture distance r x from an unsaturated crosslinker, the chain ends are attached. With a stoichmetric number x of crosslinkers, the long time kinetics for the number of free ends and the number of unsaturated crosslinkers decays as a power law in time t ?a , with a?0.5 for the present range of chain lengths. The resulting networks are then used to study the effect of entanglements on the motion of the crosslinks and the modulus of the network. Using a cluster search algorithm, the microscopic characteristics of the networks are determined. This allows us to compare our simulated networks to theoretical models of rubberelasticity without any adjustable parameters. While our results for the modulus are close to the phantom network model for the shortest chains, for the longer chains our results clearly support the Edwards tube model. Already for the presently employed largest chains the modulus is about 1.9 times larger than predicted from the affine model. Asymptotically, within an affine network model, about 2.2 entanglement lengths are needed to contribute to the modulus in the same way as one elastically active chemical crosslink. The data agree very well with recent experiments.},

In particular, it is sufficient to know the distribution of lengths and vector‐mean extensions of the segments of the network, or only the latter distribution if it is of Gaussian form. The assumption that the vector‐mean extensions have a Gaussian distribution corresponds to a similar postulate in the theory of Wall, and has been applied to a simplified network theory by Flory. In the complete theory it leads to calculation of the same proportionality between the rigidity of the material and the number Ga of segments, per unit volume, in the ``active'' part of the molecular network. However, consideration of the process of cure shows that this assumption cannot be expected to be correct, though it does lead to results of the right order of magnitude...},

abstract = {Stress?strain and rupture data were determined on an unfilled styrene?butadiene vulcanizate at temperatures from ?45 to 35°C and at extension rates from 0.0096 to 9.6 min?1. The data were represented by four functions: (1) the well‐known temperature function (shift factor) aT; (2) the constant strain rate modulus, F(t,T), reduced to temperature T0 and time t/aT, i.e., T0F(t/aT)/T; (3) the time‐dependent maximum extensibility, $\lambda$m(t/aT); and (4) a function $\Omega$($\chi$) where $\chi$ = ($\lambda$ ? 1)$\lambda$m0/$\lambda$m, in which $\lambda$ is the extension ratio and $\lambda$m0 is the maximum extensibility under equilibrium conditions. The constant strain rate modulus characterizes the stress?time response to a constant extension rate at small strains, within the range of linear response; $\lambda$m is a material parameter needed to represent the response at large $\lambda$; and $\Omega$($\chi$) represents the stress?strain curve of the material in a reference state of unit modulus and $\lambda$m = $\lambda$m. The shift factor aT was found to be sensibly independent of extension. At all values of t/aT for which the maximum extensibility is time‐independent, the relaxation rate was also found to be independent of $\lambda$. These observations indicate that the monomeric friction coefficient is strain‐independent over the ranges of T and $\lambda$ covered in the present study. It was found that $\lambda$m0 = 8.6 and that the largest extension ratio at break, ($\lambda$b)max, is 7.3. Thus, rupture always occurs before the network is fully extended. },

Many single chain theories and models start with predicting the LVE spectrum to validate their assumptions. However, until now, no reliable linear stress relaxation data were available from simulations of multichain systems. In this work, we propose a new efficient way to calculate a wide variety of correlation functions and mean-square displacements during simulations without significant additional CPU cost. Using this method, we calculate stress-stress autocorrelation functions for a simple bead-spring model of polymer melt for a wide range of chain lengths, densities, temperatures, and chain stiffnesses. The obtained stress-stress autocorrelation functions were compared with the single chain slip-spring model in order to obtain entanglement related parameters, such as the plateau modulus or the molecular weight between entanglements. Then, the dependence of the plateau modulus on the packing length is discussed. We have also identified three different contributions to the stress relaxation: bond length relaxation, colloidal and polymeric. Their dependence on the density and the temperature is demonstrated for short unentangled systems without inertia.},

In the ion gel system, we focused on the pH (or H(+) concentration) dependence of the gelation reaction. We thus applied the protic ionic liquid (pIL), 1-ethylimidazolium TFSA ([C2ImH][TFSA]), as a nonvolatile H(+) source, and added it into the solvent aIL. It was found that the gelation time of TetraPEG ion gel can be successfully controlled from 1 min to 3 h depending on the concentration of pIL (cpIL = 0-3 mM). This suggests that the acid-base properties of TetraPEG-NH2 showing acid-base equilibrium (-NH2 + H(+) ? -NH3(+)) in the solutions play a key role in the gelation process. The acid dissociation constants, pKa's of TetraPEG-NH3(+) and C2ImH(+) (cation of pIL) in aIL were directly determined by potentiometric titration to be 16.4 and 13.7, respectively. This indicates that most of the H(+) ions bind to TetraPEG-NH2 and then C2ImH(+) exists as neutral C2Im. The reaction efficiency of amide bond (cross-linked point) systematically decreased with increasing cpIL, which was reflected to the mechanical strength of the ion gels. From these results, we discuss the gelation mechanism of TetraPEG in aIL to point out the relationship between polymer network structure and [H(+)] in the solutions.},

abstract = {Similar to entangled ropes, polymer chains cannot slide through each other. These topological constraints, the so-called entanglements, dominate the viscoelastic behavior of high-molecular-weight polymeric liquids. Tube models of polymer dynamics and rheology are based on the idea that entanglements confine a chain to small fluctuations around a primitive path which follows the coarse-grained chain contour. To establish the microscopic foundation for these highly successful phenomenological models, we have recently introduced a method for identifying the primitive path mesh that characterizes the microscopic topological state of computer-generated conformations of long-chain polymer melts and solutions. Here we give a more detailed account of the algorithm and discuss several key aspects of the analysis that are pertinent for its successful use in analyzing the topology of the polymer configurations. We also present a slight modification of the algorithm that preserves the previously neglected self-entanglements and allows us to distinguish between local self-knots and entanglements between distant sections of the same chain. Our results indicate that the latter make a negligible contribution to the tube and that the contour length between local self-knots, Nlk is significantly larger than the entanglement length Ne.},

abstract = {Within their thermoforming range amorphous polymers are deformed while they are in their rubbery state (i.e., above glass transition temperature). In this range their mechanical behavior results of a combination of hyperplasic, viscous and anelastic components. Roughly speaking constitutive model should account for very specific and coupled temperature and strain rate effects and for the combination of some anelastic strain and heperelasticity. Based on experimental data obtained in monotonic and non monotonic tension over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures a revisited network model is presented that allow modeling strain rate and temperature dependence and loading unloading loops. This “visco hyperlestic” models allows 3D modeling a thermodynamical frame and should allow easier numerical modeling though some physical aspects should be assessed now. Paper also stress on the necessary quality of experimental measurements.},

@article{Everaers1996a,
abstract = {Many fundamental questions for the understanding of polymer melts and networks are more suitably addressed by current computer simulations than by experiments. The reason is that simulations have simultaneous access to the microscopic structure and the macroscopic behavior of well-defined model systems. The coarse-grained models used often bear little relation to actual chemical species. This is justified by the experimentally established universality of polymer dynamics and no limitation for the test and development of theories which are directed at these universal aspects. The difficulties already encountered on this level will be illustrated for entanglements between polymers which dominate the dynamic in dense systems. For practical purposes it would, of coarse, be desirable to predict the characteristic length and time scales of experimental systems from the chemical structure of the polymer chains. Due to the extremely long relaxation times it is impossible to achieve this in brute-force simulations of truely microscopic models. Systematic coarse-graining combined with a better theoretical understanding seem to offer a practical alternative.},

Since the entanglement length N e is found to be approximately 35, our chains cover the crossover from the nonentangled to the entangled regime. The Rouse model provides an excellent description for short chains N{\textless}N e , while the dynamics of the long chains can be described by the reptation model. By mapping the model chains onto chemical species we give estimates of the times and distances of onset of the slowing down in motion due to reptation. Comparison to neutron spin‐echo data confirm our mapping procedure, resolving a discrepancy between various experiments. By considering the primitive chain we are able to directly visualize the confinement to a tube. Analyzing the Rouse mode relaxation allows us to exclude the generalized Rouse models, while the original reptation prediction gives a good description of the data.},

These include a relationship between the surface work and the true surface energy of the solid, an explanation of certain departures from standard fracture mechanics obtained with inelastic materials, and a prediction and explanation of the phenomenon of notch brittleness.

abstract = {The concept of a "bound rubber" phase extending over nanometre-scale distances from the interface of rubber-particle nanocomposites is generally accepted. However, the thickness and elastic properties of this interphase have not been confirmed by direct experimental observation. Here, we demonstrate the existence of bound rubber in hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR)-carbon black composites, through direct visualization and measurement of elastic properties. Both macro- and nanoscale mechanical analyses show that the bound rubber exhibits an elastic modulus distinct from that of the rubber matrix and of the particles. Direct visualization of this bound rubber viascanning probe microscopy-based approaches requires detailed consideration of potential artifacts in contact-based analysis of viscoelastic nanocomposites. We quantify the magnitude of such contributions, and find that the bound rubber content decreases with increasing temperature, and that its stiffness exceeds that of the rubber matrix by approximately one order of magnitude. Further, the measured thickness and elastic moduli of this bound rubber are consistent with that predicted by our numerical model of a matrix-interphase-particle composite. Together, these experiments and model demonstrate that the elastic properties of nanocomposite interphases of less than 20 nm thickness can be interrogated directly.},

When the product ($\beta$Ca) becomes greater than unity the new theory predicts that cleavage stresses concentrate within a fractional layer of the total adhesive thickness f(a) and the peel force P tends to achieve a constant value Pmax. This new theory is verified by experimental studies and the experimental analysis suggests new optimizations in the design and measurement of the peel adhesive bond.},

abstract = {A range of tough materials (e.g., metals and polymer solids) exhibit a characteristic mechanical behavior, that is, a combination of yielding and subsequent rehardening. We numerically investigate how the combination of these mechanical behaviors enhances resistance to crack propagation.Our system has a 2-dimensional square lattice structure where pairs of adjacent lattice points are connected by “special” bonds. An isolated bond behaves as a linear spring for small deformations, but yields at a threshold force to produce a plateau in its force-deformation curve, and then shows rehardening on further loading up to a critical force of bond-breaking; on unloading from above the yielding point, the force rapidly decreases with deformation (hysteresis). We simulate crack propagation in the entire system (the square lattice structure) from an initial crack driven by boundary loading. The threshold force for bond-yielding is varied as a simulation parameter, while the critical force for bond-breaking in the rehardening regime is fixed to 1. In other words, the substantial simulation parameter is the ratio between the yielding and breaking forces. We find that the fracture behavior drastically changes depending on the ratio: when the ratio is low, the bond-breaking energy (of a single bond) is low, but more work is required to fracture the entire system via the crack propagation. The opposite tendency between the bond-breaking energy and the fracture work is due to formation of a well-developed yielding zone around the crack tip.},

abstract = {In recent years, research utilizing micro- and nanoscale geometries and structures on biomaterials to manipulate cellular behaviors, such as differentiation, proliferation, survival, and motility, have gained much popularity; however, how the surface microtopography of 3D objects, such as implantable devices, can affect these various cell behaviors still remains largely unknown. In this study, we discuss how the walls of microgroove topography can influence the morphology and the motility of unrestrained cells, in a different fashion from 2D line micropatterns. Here adhesive substrates made of tetra(polyethylene glycol) (tetra-PEG) hydrogels with microgroove structures or 2D line micropatterns were fabricated, and cell motility on these substrates was evaluated. Interestingly, despite being unconstrained, the cells exhibited drastically different migration behaviors at the edges of the 2D micropatterns and the walls of microgroove structures.

The microscopic test model is generic but retains features like hard excluded volume interactions and realistic melt densities. The microscopic representation is mapped onto a model of soft spheres with fluctuating size, where each sphere represents a microscopic subchain with Nb monomers. By varying Nb, a hierarchy of CG representations at different resolutions is obtained. Within this hierarchy, CG configurations equilibrated with Monte Carlo at low resolution are sequentially fine-grained into CG melts described with higher resolution. A Molecular Dynamics scheme is employed to slowly introduce the microscopic details into the latter. All backmapping steps involve only local polymer relaxation; thus, the computational efficiency of the scheme is independent of molecular weight, being just proportional to system size. To...},

The stress-softening phenomenon that occurs in rubber-like materials during cyclic loading is analysed from a physical point of view. The Mullins effect is considered to be a consequence of the breakage of links inside the material. Both filler-matrix and chain interaction links are involved in the phenomenon. This new alteration theory is implemented by modifying the eight-chains constitutive equation of Arruda and Boyce (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 41 (2) (1993) 389). In the present method the parameters of the eight-chains model, denoted C(R) and N in the bibliography, become functions of the maximum chain stretch ratio. The accuracy of the resulting constitutive equation is demonstrated on cyclic uniaxial experiments for both natural rubbers and synthetic elastomers. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Glasses can be formed by many routes. In some cases, distinct polyamorphic forms are found. The normal mode of glass formation is cooling of a viscous liquid. Liquid behavior during cooling is classified between "strong" and "fragile," and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. Strong liquids become fragile liquids on compression. In some cases, such conversions occur during cooling by a weak first-order transition. This behavior can be related to the polymorphism in a glass state through a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such first-order transitions is suggestive of the polyamorphic transition between native and denatured hydrated proteins, which can be interpreted as single-chain glass-forming polymers plasticized by water and cross-linked by hydrogen bonds.

abstract = {The tensile stress at break ($\sigma$b) and the associated ultimate strain (?b) of an elastomer depend on (1) the chemical and topological characteristics of the polymeric network, and (2) the test conditions under which rupture is observed. To separate these effects, the ultimate tensile properties can often be characterized by a “failure envelope” defined by values of $\sigma$b and ?b determined at various strain rates over a wide temperature range. Provided time?temperature superposition is applicable, such data superpose on a plot of log $\sigma$bT?/T versus log ?b, where T is the test temperature (absolute) and T0 is an arbitrarily selected reference temperature. The resulting failure envelope is independent of time (strain rate) and temperature and thus it depends only on basic characteristics of the polymeric network. To illustrate the characterization method, data on two styrene?butadiene gum vulcanizates, SBR‐I and SBR‐II, were analyzed. For SBR‐I, values of $\sigma$b and ?b obtained over extensive ranges of strain rate and temperature superposed to give a failure envelope. Data at elevated temperatures also gave a reliable value for the equilibrium modulus. For SBR‐II, data obtained at various temperatures under conditions of constant strain and constant strain rate yielded identical failure envelopes; this strongly suggests that the failure envelope is independent of the test method. A theoretical consideration of the time‐to‐rupture associated with different test methods showed that for given values of $\sigma$b and ?b the time‐to‐rupture from the following types of tests should increase in the order: constant strain {\textless} constant stress {\textless} constant strain rate {\textless} constant stress rate. },

The hydrogels can endure a compressive stress up to 60 megapascals and can be stretched more than sevenfold without hysteresis.

abstract = {We develop and solve a new molecular model for nonlinear elasticity of entangled polymer networks. This model combines and generalizes several succeseful ideas introduced over the years in the field of the rubber elasticity. The topological constraints imposed by the neighboring network chains on a given network are represented by the confining potential that changes upon network deformation. This topological potential restricts fluctuations of the network chain to the nonaffinely deformed confining tube. Network chains are allowed to fluctuate and redistribute their length along the contour of their confining tubes. The dependence of the stress $\sigma$ on the elongation coefficient $\lambda$ for the uniaxially deformed network is usially represented in the form of the Mooney stress, f*(1/$\lambda$) ) $\sigma$/($\lambda$ - 1/$\lambda$2). We find a simple expression for the Mooney stress, f*(1/$\lambda$))Gc+Ge/(0.74$\lambda$+0.61$\lambda$-1/2-0.35), whereGc andGe are phantom and entangled network moduli. This allows one to analyze the experimental data in the form of the universal plot and to obtain the two moduli Gc and Ge related to the densities of cross-links and entanglements of the individual networks. The predictions of our new model are in good agreement with experimental data for uniaxially deformed polybutadiene, poly(dimethylsiloxane), and natural rubber networks, as well as with recent computer simulations. 1.},

abstract = {The structure of Tetra-PEG gel, a new class of biocompatible, easy-made, and high-strength hydrogel consisting of a four-arm polyethylene glycol (PEG) network, has been investigated by means of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Since the Tetra-PEG gel is prepared by cross-end-coupling two kinds of four-arm PEG macromers having different functional groups at the ends, i.e., amine group and succinimidyl ester group respectively, the coupling reaction occurs exclusively between PEG chains carrying different functional groups. SANS results showed that the four-arm PEG macromer aqueous solutions and Tetra-PEG gels were successfully described by the theoretical scattering function for multiarm Gaussian chains and the Ornstein-Zernike function, respectively. Surprisingly, no noticeable excess scattering that originated from cross-linking was observed in Tetra-PEG gels, suggesting that its network structure is extremely uniform. Investigations on nonstoichiometric Tetra-PEG gels showed weakening of the mechanical properties as well as an increase of dangling chains (defects) in the network. It is concluded that Tetra-PEG gels have an extremely uniform network structure, probably mimicking a diamond-like structure, and this is one of the reasons for the advanced mechanical properties of Tetra-PEG gels.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional molecular network theories are studied which use a non-Gaussian statistical mechanics model for the large strain extension of molecules. Invoking an affine deformation assumption, the evolution of the network - consisting of a large number of molecular chains per unit volume, which are initially randomly oriented in space - is shown to be governed by a balance equation in orientation space. Eulerian and Lagrangian type formulations of these balance equations are given, and the closed-form analytical solution for the so-called Chain Orientation Distribution Function is derived. This full network model is then used to describe the large strain inelastic behaviour of rubber-like materials. Detailed comparisons with experimental results and with two approximate models, namely the classical three-chain model and a very recently proposed eight-chain model, are provided for different types of deformation and rubbers. Finally, the network model is applied to describe the orientational hardening in amorphous glassy polymers, and confronted with experimental data for polycarbonate. The inherent physical limitations of the network theory for both applications are discussed. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {Several methods for preparing well equilibrated melts of long chains polymers are studied. We show that the standard method in which one starts with an ensemble of chains with the correct end-to-end distance arranged randomly in the simulation cell and introduces the excluded volume rapidly, leads to deformation on short length scales. This deformation is strongest for long chains and relaxes only after the chains have moved their own size. Two methods are shown to overcome this local deformation of the chains. One method is to first pre-pack the Gaussian chains, which reduces the density fluctuations in the system, followed by a gradual introduction of the excluded volume. The second method is a double-pivot algorithm in which new bonds are formed across a pair of chains, creating two new chains each substantially different from the original. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods for a linear bead spring polymer model with both zero and nonzero bending stiffness, however the methods are applicable to more complex architectures such as branched and star polymer.},

abstract = {Physically based models which describe the finite strain behavior of vulcanized rubber are developed. Constitutive laws for elasticity and viscoelasticity are derived by integrating over orientation space the forces due to each individual polymer chain. A novel scheme is presented which effectively approximates these integrals in terms of strain and strain invariants. In addition, the details involving the implementation of such models into a quasi-static large strain finite element formulation are provided. In order to account for the finite extensibility of a molecular chain, Langevin statistics is used to model the chain response. The classical statistical model of rubber assumes that polymer chains interact only at the chemical crosslinks. It is shown that such model when fitted for uniaxial tension data cannot fit compression or equibiaxial data. A model which incorporates the entanglement interactions of surrounding chains, in addition to the finite extensibility of the chains, is shown to give better predictions than the classical model. The technique used for approximating the orientation space integral was applied to both the classical and entanglement models. A viscoelasticity model based on the force equilibration process as described by Doi and Edwards is developed. An assumed form for the transient force in the chain is postulated. The resulting stress tensor is composed of an elastic and a viscoelastic portion with the elastic stress given by the proposed entanglement model. In order to improve the simulation of experimental data, it was found necessary to include the effect of unattached or dangling polymer chains in the viscoelasticity model. The viscoelastic effect of such chains is the manifestation of a disengagement process. This disengagement model for unattached polymer chains motivated an empirical model which was very successful in simulating the experimental results considered.},

In this research, we have comprehensively studied the implementation of tetra-PEG gel into microfluidic device technology. First, the fabrication of tetra-PEG gel/PDMS hybrid microchannels was established by developing a simple and robust bonding technique. Second, some fundamental features of tetra-PEG gel/PDMS hybrid microchannels, particularly fluid flow and mass transfer, were studied. Finally, to demonstrate the unique application of tetra-PEG-gel-integrated microfluidic devices, the generation of patterned chemical modulation with the maximum concentration gradient: 10{\%} per 20 $\mu$m in a hydrogel was performed. The techniques developed in this study are expected to provide fundamental and beneficial methods of developing various microfluidic devices for life science and biomedical applications.},

abstract = {The pure shear deformation of the Tetra-polyethylene glycol gels reveals the presence of an explicit cross-effect of strains in the strain energy density function even for the polymer networks with nearly regular structure including no appreciable amount of structural defect such as trapped entanglement. This result is in contrast to the expectation of the classical Gaussian network model (Neo Hookean model), i.e., the vanishing of the cross effect in regular networks with no trapped entanglement. The results show that (1) the cross effect of strains is not dependent on the network-strand length; (2) the cross effect is not affected by the presence of non-network strands; (3) the cross effect is proportional to the network polymer concentration including both elastically effective and ineffective strands; (4) no cross effect is expected exclusively in zero limit of network concentration in real polymer networks. These features indicate that the real polymer networks with regular network structures have an explicit cross-effect of strains, which originates from some interaction between network strands (other than entanglement effect) such as nematic interaction, topological interaction, and excluded volume interaction.},

This series of controlled network structures, for the first time, enabled us to quantitatively examine the Lake-Thomas model, which is the most popular model predicting fracture energies of elastomers. The experimental data showed good agreement with the Lake-Thomas model, and indicated a new molecular interpretation for the displacement length (L), the area around a crack tip within which the network strands are fully stretched. L corresponded to the three times of end-to-end distance of network strands, regardless of all parameters examined.

abstract = {Electrostatic interactions have been incorporated in dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulation. The electrostatic field is solved locally on a grid. Within this formalism, local inhomogeneities in the electrostatic permittivity can be treated without any problem. Key issues like the screening of the potential near a charged surface and the Stillinger-Lovett moment conditions are satisfied. This implies that the method captures the essential features of electrostatic interaction. For the direct simulation of mixed surfactants near oil-water interfaces, or for the simulation of Coulombic polymer-surfactant interactions, this method has all the advantages of DPD over full atomistic molecular dynamics (MD). DPD has proven to be faster than MD by many orders of magnitude, depending on the precise scaling factor chosen for the simulation. This brings phenomena of microseconds in reach of routine simulation, while maintaining a fairly accurate representation of the structure of the molecules. As an example of this simulation tool, the interaction between a cationic polyelectrolyte and anionic surfactant is discussed. Without a surfactant, the polyelectrolyte shows a fractal dimensionality that is in line with the theoretical and experimental values cited in literature, it behaves as a fairly stiff rod, d(f)similar to1.1. When salt is replaced by anionic surfactant, the polymer wraps around one or more discrete surfactant micelles, in line with the current understanding of these systems, and scaling invariance in the correlation function is broken.

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of correlations between fragility and other parameters of glass-forming systems. The analysis shows the importance of the ratio between the instantaneous bulk and shear modulus of glass-forming systems, or their Poisson ratio, for structural alpha relaxation and fast dynamics. In particular, for simple glass formers, the bulk to shear modulus ratio in the glassy state correlates with fragility in the liquid state and is inversely proportional to the intensity of the boson peak. A simple relationship between the temperature dependence of the viscosity of liquids at high temperatures and near the glass transition is used to rationalize these correlations. We argue that the ratio of the moduli controls the high-temperature activation energy of the structural relaxation and in this way affects the fragility. The ratio also defines the amplitude of the structural relaxation (i.e., the nonergodicity parameter) and the latter influences the strength of the boson peak. These observations might explain the puzzling correlation observed between the fragility and fast dynamics in glass-forming systems.},

abstract = {The effects of sequential cross-linking and scission of polymer networks formed in two states of strain are investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Two-stage networks are studied in which a network formed in the unstrained state (stage 1) undergoes additional cross-linking in a uniaxially strained state (stage 2). The equilibrium stress is measured before and after removing some or all of the original (stage 1) cross-links. The results are interpreted in terms of a generalized independent network hypothesis. In networks where the first-stage cross-links are subsequently removed, a fraction (quantified by the stress transfer function Phi) of the second-stage cross-links contribute to the effective first-stage cross-link density. The stress transfer functions extracted from the MD simulations of the reacting networks are found to be in very good agreement with the predictions of Flory and Fricker. It was found that the fractional stress reduction upon removal of the first-stage cross-links could be accurately calculated from the slip tube model of Rubinstein and Panyukov modified to use the theoretical transfer functions of Fricker.},

abstract = {A theory describing the elastic modulus for percolation networks of Gaussian chains on general lattices such as square and cubic lattices is proposed and its validity is examined with simulation and mechanical experiments on well-defined polymer networks. The theory was developed by generalizing the effective medium approximation (EMA) for Hookian spring network to Gaussian chain networks. From EMA theory, we found that the ratio of the elastic modulus at p, G to that at p = 1, G0, must be equal to G/G0 = (p - 2/f)/(1 - 2/f) if the position of sites can be determined so as to meet the force balance, where p is the degree of cross-linking reaction. However, the EMA prediction cannot be applicable near its percolation threshold because EMA is a mean field theory. Thus, we combine real-space renormalization and EMA and propose a theory called real-space renormalized EMA, i.e., REMA. The elastic modulus predicted by REMA is in excellent agreement with the results of simulations and experiments of near-ideal diamond lattice gels.},

abstract = {Tough double network (DN) hydrogels are a kind of interpenetrating network (IPN) gels with a contrasting structure; they consist of a rigid and brittle 1st network with dilute, densely cross-linked short chains and a soft and ductile 2nd network with concentrated, loosely cross-linked long chains. In this work, we focus on how the brittle gel changes into a tough one by increasing the amount of ductile component. By comparing the molecular structures of the individual first network and second network gels, we found that the true key mechanical factor that governs the brittle-ductile transition is the fracture stress ratio of the two networks, ??f,2/??f,1. This ratio is related to the density ratio of elastically effective polymer strands of the two networks, ??e,2/??e,1, where the inter-network topological entanglement makes dominant contribution to ??e,2. When ??e,2/??e,1 {\textless} k = 3.8-9.5, the second network fractures right after the fracture of the first network, and the gels are brittle. When ??e,2/??e,1 {\textgreater} k, only the first network fractures. As a result, the brittle first network serves as sacrificial bonds, imparting toughness of DN gels. The study also confirms that the load transfer between the two networks is via inter-network topological entanglement. This result provides essential information to design tough materials based on the double network concept. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The relationship between Tgand degree of cure is also established. The degree of cure obtained from Raman spectroscopy and DEA under isothermal conditions is compared to that obtained from DSC. A good agreement is observed among the three methods, supporting the potential of these in situ cure monitoring methods during manufacturing.

abstract = {Polymer gels have two types of concentration fluctuations; liquidlike and solidlike fluctuations. The former are time-dependent (thermal) fluctuations and the latter are time-independent spatial inhomogeneity. The static structure factor, obtained by small-angle X-ray (SAXS) or neutron scattering (SANS), consists of both contributions. Several methods which allow to decompose the static structure factor into the individual contributions are reviewed. In practice, however, the decomposition is not as easy as that predicted by the theory due to the lack of information about dynamic fluctuations. The dynamic light scattering technique (DLS), on the other hand, provides the complimentary information of the dynamic fluctuations. It will be shown that DLS becomes a powerful tool to distinguish the two contributions if it is coupled with ensemble averaging. In this article, recent developments of the structure investigation of polymer gels, particularly those of environmental sensitive polymer gels, are reviewed from both experimental and theoretical points of view. The advantage to use the environmental sensitive gels is that the structure of a gel can be examined as a function of its environmental parameters, e.g., temperature, concentration, and pH. Furthermore, the characteristic features of these environmental sensitive gels, such as a volume phase transition and phase separation, are extensively discussed in terms of the thermal fluctuations and the spatial inhomogeneity.},

The separability is applicable except for the strain stiffening regimes resulting from the finite extensibility of polymer chains. This new analysis method should have a wide applicability not only for hydrogels but also for other highly viscoelastic soft solids such as soft adhesives or living tissues.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society.We report a high-toughness ion gel with a nearly ideal polymer network prepared in an imidazolium-based aprotic ionic liquid (aIL) with a controlled solution pH. We formed the ion gel from tetra-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (TetraPEG), i.e., an A-B-type cross-end coupling reaction of two different TetraPEG prepolymers. To complete this A-B-type reaction, we needed to optimize the reaction rate such that the two TetraPEGs were mixed homogeneously, which strongly depends on the pH or [H+] in the aIL solution. To control solution pH, we established a "pH-buffering IL" by adding an imidazolium-based protic IL (as a proton source) and its conjugated base to the solvent aIL. We demonstrated that the pH-buffering IL exhibits a successful pH-buffering effect to maintain a constant pH (?16.2, apparent value) during the gelation reaction. From a kinetic study, we found that the gelation reaction undergoes a simple second-order reaction of the two TetraPEGs in the pH-buffering IL. The gelation rate constant, kgel, in the present ion gel system was 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that in the corresponding hydrogel system, which is ascribed to the difference in the activation entropy, $\Delta$S‡, of the cross-end coupling reactions. The reaction efficiency at the cross-linking point was experimentally estimated to be 92{\%} by spectroscopic measurements. We thus conclude that a nearly ideal polymer network was formed in the pH-buffering IL system. This is reflected in the excellent mechanical property of the ion gel, even at a low polymer content (=6 wt {\%}).},

@article{Wang1952,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to develop a selfconsistent theory of rubber-like materials consisting of networks of non-Gaussian chain molecules. Three kinds of series developments are derived for the distribution function of perfectly flexible single chains from the Fourier integral solution of Rayleigh; namely, (11 long chains with actual extension much less than the maximum exten- sion, (2) long chains with actual extension comparable to the maximum extension, and (3) short chains. In the non-Gaussian network theory, the leading term of the series (2) is used as the starting point for the individual chains of the network. Calcula- tions are made for the case where the free junctions are moving with no restriction, and for the case where the free junctions are assumed to be at their most probable positions. The final expres- sions of the elastic energy for the two cases are compared, and it is shown that the percentage difference of the two expressions is of the order lin (n being the average number of links per chain), which is negligible for sufficiently large n. Finally an expression of the elastic energy is obtained with the assumption that all junc- tions are fixed and is shown to be, in general, a function of three strain invariants. The interdependence of the coefficients of the invariants is shown. Comparison of theory and experiment is given. Because of the interdependence of the coefficients only part of the observed deviations from Gaussian theory can be ex- plained by our molecular theory. The remaining discrepancies must be ascribed to van der Waals forces. This should show up in the (not yet investigated) temperature dependence of these dis- crepancies.},

abstract = {The reaction rate for the polycondensation in the Tetra-PEG gel system, i.e., A?B type coupling reaction between mutually reactive two four-arm polymers, has been studied by ATR-IR spectroscopy. It was found that (1) the polycondensation kinetics of Tetra-PEG gel can be simply treated as a chemical reaction between mutually reactive end-groups in solution, (2) the reaction undergoes as a simple second-order reaction from beginning to end regardless of gelation threshold, and (3) the gelation mechanism was predicted from the thermodynamic enthalpy and entropy at the transition state estimated by temperature dependence of rate constants. The reson of smooth second-order kinetics is suspected to be that the mean-field approximation can be applied to the reactivity of terminal groups on Tetra-PEGs; i.e., the reactivity of terminal groups on Tetra-PEGs is not affected by the steric hindrance, substitution effet, and gelation threshold.},

abstract = {A polymer cross-linking system undergoes a phase transition from liquid to solid at a critical point, which is called the sol-gel transition. The sol-gel transition is often understood in the context of the lattice-based percolation model. Two parameters govern the sol-gel transition including the connectivity and polymer concentration. In this study, we independently tuned these parameters and experimentally accessed the sol-gel transition point as a function of connectivity and concentration using a model gel system (tetra-polyethylene glycol gel). The connectivity required to percolate the system continuously increased as the polymer concentration decreased, which is completely different from that predicted by the site-bond percolation model. The viscoelastic behavior at the critical points indicates that the fractal dimension of the percolation clusters deviated from the prediction of the lattice-based percolation model as the polymer concentration decreased. These results indicate that the lattice assumption cannot be applied for a gelling system prepared far below the overlapping concentration.},

The reaction rate constant for the gelation of Tetra-PEG, kgel, was determined in aqueous solutions with varying both prepolymer volume fraction, ?, and molecular weight, Mw, of the prepolymers. It was clearly found that the value of kgel is independent of both ? and Mw, and is comparable to that of the corresponding linear-PEG system. The kgel value is obtained to be around 70 dm3 mol?1 s?1, which is much smaller than the reaction rates of typical diffusion-controlled reaction (e.g., 108?109 dm3 mol?1 s?1) and of cross-linking photopolymerization (104?105 dm3 mol?1 s?1).

It owes its popularity to its computational efficiency, rather than its ability to represent specific polymer species and conditions. Here we investigate how to adapt the model to match the universal properties of a wide range of chemical polymers species. For this purpose we vary a single parameter originally introduced by Faller and M$\backslash$"uller-Plathe, the chain stiffness. Examples include polystyrene, polyethylene, polypropylene, cis-polyisoprene, polydimethylsiloxane, polyethyleneoxide and styrene-butadiene rubber. We do this by matching the number of Kuhn segments per chain and the number of Kuhn segments per cubic Kuhn volume for the polymer species and for the Kremer-Grest model. We also derive mapping relations for converting KG model units back to physical units, in particular we obtain the entanglement time for the KG model as function of stiffness allowing for a time mapping. To test these relations, we generate large equilibrated well entangled polymer melts, and measure the entanglement moduli using a static primitive-path analysis of the entangled melt structure as well as by simulations of step-strain deformation of the model melts. The obtained moduli for our model polymer melts are in good agreement with the experimentally expected moduli.},

The first model indicates that general rubber vulcanizate consists of the heterogeneous structure, partially continuous cross-linked phase (75{\%}) and continuous uncross-linked phase (25{\%}). In addition, the author proposed other new models and concept for the strain-induced crystallization in vulcanized NR, in which the strain-induced crystallization takes place in the uncross-linked phase in cross-linked rubber. In the uncross-linked phase under large extension, molecular flow and orientation occur due to the very high compressive, shear and tensile stresses generated by the surrounding hard cross-linked phases, which makes the strain-induced crystallization possible in the uncross-linked phase. As macroscopic extension increases, the crystallization spreads over the whole uncross-linked phases, thus the uncross-linked phase changes its character from original soft rubber to the strong super network consisting of a bundle of extended molecules interconnected at the crystals. The characteristic phenomena observed in the stress-strain relation of NR such as the stress-upturn, high tensile strength and large stress-softening (Mullins effect) can be reasonably explained using these models and concepts. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate polymer networks made by either end-linking or randomly crosslinking a melt of linear precursor chains. The resulting network structures are very different, since end-linking leads to nearly ideal monodisperse networks, while random crosslinking leads to polydisperse networks, characterized by an exponential strand length distribution. Networks with average strand length 20 and 100 were generated. These networks were used to study the effects of disorder in the network connectivity on observables averaged either over the entire network or selected sub-structures. Heterogeneities in the randomly crosslinked networks cause significant differences in the localization of monomers, however, neither the localization of crosslinks nor the microscopic strain response are significantly affected. Compared to end-linked networks, randomly crosslinked networks have a slightly increased tube diameter, and as a result a slightly decreased shear modulus, but otherwise identical stress-strain behavior. For the investigated systems, we conclude that the microscopic strain response, tube diameter, and stress-strain relation are all insensitive to the heterogeneities due to the linking process by which the network were made. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the past, the stress-strain behavior of natural rubber has been studied by a variety of mechanical analytical techniques in order to understand the role of induced crystallization by deformation. But, this was generally done in a sequential manner by stretching to a certain extent and examining the stretched part separately. This type of sequential experiment may not follow the exact dynamics of the process and thus may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the evolution of microscopic mechanisms. It is therefore advantageous to measure the mechanical response simultaneously with the structural response to map the structural evolution onto the stress-strain behavior. In this paper, simultaneous measurements of the stress-strain behavior and X-ray scattering intensity of vulcanized natural rubber were made continuously by a specially designed instrument during elongation and subsequent retraction. These studies revealed three new characteristics of the strain-induced crystallization. 1. The strain-induced crystallization starts at around 400{\%} strain at 25??C, then increases steeply, although sequential measurements reported that natural rubber starts strain-induced crystallization at 200{\%}. 2. At the onset of retracting, the degree of crystallinity continues to increase, although a drastic decrease of stress occurs. We suggest the morphology of the strain-induced crystallites changes such that do not contribute to stress. 3. Strain-induced crystallites disappear at the strain where the stress-strain loop is closed during retracting. The hysteresis of the stress-strain curve might be attributed to strain-induced crystallization. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The constitutive equations for the neo-Hookean model, the 3-chain model, and the equivalent 4- and 8-chain models are then derived from theWu and van der Giessen equation. The squared chain stretch of an arbitrarily directed chain averaged over a unit sphere surrounding all chains radiating from a cross-link junction as its center is determined. An average-stretch, full-network constitutive equation is then derived by approximation of the Wu and van der Giessen equation. This result, though more general in that no special chain cell morphology is introduced, is the same as the constitutive equation for the 4- and 8-chainmodels. Some concluding remarks on extensions to amended models are presented.},

abstract = {As a new class of high-strength hydrogels, we designed a tetra-PEG gel by combining two symmetrical tetrahedron-like macromonomers of the same size. Because the nanostructural unit of the gel network was defined by the length of the tetrahedral PEG arm, the gel had a homogeneous structure and resultant high mechanical strength comparable to that of native articular cartilage. Furthermore, since the gel was formed by mixing two biocompatible macromonomer solutions, the gelation reaction itself and the resultant gel were also biocompatible. The breaking strength had local maxima at the overlap concentration of the macromonomers (C*) and at 2C*. Dynamic light scattering measurement indicated the near absence of inhomogeneities in the network at C*. Thus, we successfully designed and fabricated a high-strength hydrogel by controlling the homogeneity of network structure for the first time, which will lead to multiplied effects, i.e., contributing to the understanding of ideal networks, providing a universal strategy for designing high-strength gels, and opening up the biomedical application of hydrogels.},

Using sacrificial bonds, we show how brittle, unfilled elastomers can be strongly reinforced in stiffness and toughness (up to 4 megapascals and 9 kilojoules per square meter) by introducing a variable proportion of isotropically prestretched chains that can break and dissipate energy before the material fails. Chemoluminescent cross-linking molecules, which emit light as they break, map in real time where and when many of these internal bonds break ahead of a propagating crack. The simple methodology that we use to introduce sacrificial bonds, combined with the mapping of where bonds break, has the potential to stimulate the development of new classes of unfilled tough elastomers and better molecular models of the fracture of soft materials.},

abstract = {We present an effective and simple multiscale method for equilibrating Kremer Grest model polymer melts of varying stiffness. In our approach, we progressively equilibrate the melt structure above the tube scale, inside the tube and finally at the monomeric scale. We make use of models designed to be computationally effective at each scale. Density fluctuations in the melt structure above the tube scale are minimized through a Monte Carlo simulated annealing of a lattice polymer model. Subsequently the melt structure below the tube scale is equilibrated via the Rouse dynamics of a force-capped Kremer-Grest model that allows chains to partially interpenetrate. Finally the Kremer-Grest force field is introduced to freeze the topological state and enforce correct monomer packing. We generate 15 melts of 500 chains of 10.000 beads for varying chain stiffness as well as a number of melts with 1.000 chains of 15.000 monomers. To validate the equilibration process we study the time evolution of bulk, collective, and single-chain observables at the monomeric, mesoscopic, and macroscopic length scales. Extension of the present method to longer, branched, or polydisperse chains, and/or larger system sizes is straightforward.},

The radius of gyration of individual pre-polymers after gelation was slightly increased compared with that of the single pre-polymer before gelation, and its distribution was broad, attributable to inter- and intra-molecular bonds. The largest pores in the unit cell were about 3.5-3.9 nm. The existence of large pores seems to explain the protein encapsulation capability of and protein leakage from the gel indicating that the CG simulation, which maintains information about potentials in actual units, is an effective tool for investigating gel properties that are difficult to measure in real experiments. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

We have established useful parameter ranges for simulations, and have made a link between these parameters and $\chi$ -parameters in Flory-Huggins-type models. This is possible because the equation of state of the DPD fluid is essentially quadratic in density. This link opens the way to do large scale simulations, effectively describing millions of atoms, by firstly performing simulations of molecular fragments retaining all atomistic details to derive $\chi$ -parameters, then secondly using these results as input to a DPD simulation to study the formation of micelles, networks, mesophases and so forth. As an example application, we have calculated the interfacial tension $\sigma$ between homopolymer melts as a function of $\chi$ and N and have found a universal scaling collapse when $\sigma$/$\rho$k B T$\chi$ 0.4 is plotted against $\chi$N for N{\textgreater}1 .

abstract = {New constitutive equations based on an amended form of the Kuhn-Gr??n probability distribution function due to Jernigan and Flory are derived from the standard James-Guth (JG) 3-chain and Arruda-Boyce (AB) 8-chain non-Gaussian molecular network models. The kinematics describing the stretch of a 1-chain model in an affine deformation shows that the relative stretch of a single molecular chain initially oriented along the diagonal of a cube is determined by the first principal invariant of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. The Kuhn-Gr??n probability distribution for a randomly oriented chain and its more general amended form due to Wang and Guth, are functions of only the relative chain stretch. Hence, any non-Gaussian network model for which the configurational entropy of all chains may be uniform is characterized by an elastic response function that depends on only the first principal invariant of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. Both the regular and amended AB 8-chain models are characterized by specific response functions in this class; the regular and amended JG 3-chain models, however, are not. An amended form of the phenomenological composite 3-chain/8-chain model suggested by Wu and van der Giessen is introduced. Analytical relations for several kinds of homogeneous deformations of the standard and amended models are compared with a variety of experimental data by others. It is found that results for the amended 3-chain and 8-chain models do not vary significantly from results for the corresponding regular models. The composite model, on the other hand, shows excellent overall agreement with the diverse data, including equibiaxial deformations for which other models show greater variance; but it offers no improvement in comparison with data for plane strain compression. Some remarks relating the chain parameters of the 3-chain and 8-chain network models, and the limiting chain and continuum stretches for these models are discussed in an appendix. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Here we review the intrinsic mechanisms of a wide variety of tough hydrogels developed over the past few decades. We show that tough hydrogels generally possess mechanisms to dissipate substantial mechanical energy but still maintain high elasticity under deformation. The integrations and interactions of different mechanisms for dissipating energy and maintaining elasticity are essential to the design of tough hydrogels. A matrix that combines various mechanisms is constructed for the first time to guide the design of next-generation tough hydrogels. We further highlight that a particularly promising strategy for the design is to implement multiple mechanisms across multiple length scales into nano-, micro-, meso-, and macro-structures of hydrogels.},

abstract = {Polymeric networks exhibiting high elasticity consist, typically, of linear chains several hundred bonds in length joined at their ends to {\$}\backslashphi {\$}-functional junctions {\$}(\backslashphi {\textgreater}2){\$}. For random unconstrained chains of this length, the density distribution of chain vectors {\$}r{\$} is Gaussian in satisfactory approximation. The chains interpenetrate copiously in the network; the domain described by the set of {\$}\backslashphi {\$} junctions that are topological neighbours of a given junction encompasses many (20-100) spatial neighbours. A phantom network is expressly defined as a hypothetical one whose chains may move freely through one another; the chains act exclusively by introducing a force that is proportional to the distance between each pair of junctions so connected. The following results of James {\&} Guth are rederived for a Gaussian phantom network using a simplified version of their procedure: (1) the mean values {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}r{\}}{\$} of the individual chain vectors are linear functions of the tensor {\$}\backslashlambda {\$} of the principal extension ratios specifying the macroscopic strain, (2) fluctuations {\$}\backslashDelta r=r-\backslashoverline{\{}r{\}}{\$} about these mean values are Gaussian, and (3) the mean-square fluctuations depend only on the structure of the network and not on the strain. Additionally, we show (4) that the distribution of the average vectors {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}r{\}}{\$} is Gaussian, and (5) that {\$}\backslashlangle (\backslashDelta r){\^{}}{\{}2{\}}\backslashrangle =(2/\backslashphi)\backslashlangle r{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}\backslashrangle {\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$}, a result obtained previously by Graessley. It follows from (1) and (3) that the transformation of chain vectors {\$}r{\$} of the phantom network is not affine in {\$}\backslashlambda {\$}, and hence that junctions exchange neighbours with strain. In real networks, the mutual interpenetration of chains pendent at a given junction must obstruct this process of local rearrangement of junctions; the transformation of chain vectors may therefore be more nearly affine in {\$}\backslashlambda {\$}, especially when the network is undiluted. The elastic free energy derived for a phantom network of any functionality and degree of imperfection reduces to {\$}\backslashDelta A{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}e1{\}}{\}}=\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}\backslashxi kT(I{\_}{\{}1{\}}-3){\$}, where {\$}I{\_}{\{}1{\}}{\$} = trace {\$}(\backslashlambda {\^{}}{\{}T{\}}\backslashlambda){\$} is the first invariant of the strain and {\$}\backslashxi {\$} is the cycle rank of the network. If the fluctuations of junctions in a real network are suppressed for the reasons stated, the elastic free energy is {\$}\backslashDelta A{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}e1{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashast{\}}=\backslashxi (1-2/\backslashphi){\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}kT(I{\_}{\{}1{\}}-3)-(2\backslashxi /\backslashphi){\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}kT{\$}ln {\$}(V/V{\^{}}{\{}0{\}}){\$}, where {\$}V{\$} and {\$}V{\^{}}{\{}0{\}}{\$} are the actual and reference volumes, respectively. The expected trend from {\$}\backslashDelta A{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}e1{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} to {\$}\backslashDelta A{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}e1{\}}{\}}{\$} with dilution may account, qualitatively at least, for the effect of dilution on the stress-strain relation. A similar trend with extension may explain the familiar departure of the observed tension-elongation relation from theory.},

@article{Corezzi2010,
abstract = {In this study we propose a new equation to describe the effect of diffusional limitations on the cure kinetics of epoxy-amine resins, based on (i) modeling the average diffusion coefficient D via a power-law relationship with the structural relaxation time $\tau$ (i.e. D$\tau$$\xi$= const, with $\xi$ a fractional exponent) and (ii) describing the increase of $\tau$ with the advancement of reaction in terms of configurational entropy reduction driven by covalent bond formation. The approach proposed reconciles the description of the diffusion-controlled kinetics with the configurational entropy-based description of the structural dynamics near vitrification, already applied successfully to epoxy-amine polymerization. The model equation is built on a modified version of the Kamal equation where the initial ratio of amino hydrogens to epoxy groups appears explicitly, in addition to the exponents m and n giving the effective order of reaction. Replacing each chemical rate constant with an overall diffusion-corrected one, allows us to describe the full polymerization process. A comparison with experimental data indicates that, contrary to what assumed in the literature, the effect of diffusional limitations cannot be properly described by assuming the diffusion coefficient to be inversely proportional to the relaxation time ($\xi$ = 1). Rather, we find that for many systems the fractional exponent $\xi$ takes values very close to the parameter $\beta$ that measures the stretching of the relaxation function. Concerning the chemically intrinsic parameters, it is found that the rate constants kc1and kc2for all the systems scale onto a master-curve corresponding to thermally activated behavior with, surprisingly, the same activation energy for the non-catalytic and autocatalytic process. Moreover, m and n assume approximately constant values, independent of the temperature and molar ratio of the mixture, with m ? 1 and n in the range between 1 and 2. Although these results contradict other reported findings and the widespread belief that the autocatalytic process has a lower activation energy, they are consistent with the expectation that a similar mechanism underlies the general reaction between epoxy group and amino hydrogen, and that m and n are related to the intrinsic reaction mechanism. The new modeling also removes some evident discrepancies among results from different studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Tetra-PEG gel has drawn much attention as a polymer gel with extremely suppressed heterogeneity, which is known as the intrinsic characteristics of polymer networks, and is difficult to control. Tetra-PEG gel is formed by a novel fabrication method, i.e., AB-type crosslink coupling, which is polycondensation between mutually reactive multi-armed polymers forming a polymer network. AB-type crosslink coupling has advantages on suppressing the heterogeneity over conventional polycondensation. In this review, we focused on the gelation reaction and the relationship between the mechanical properties and structure. The reaction proceeded as a simple second order reaction of A and B end-groups from the initiation to the end (approx. 90{\%}), suggesting the homogeneous mixing of two prepolymers. The model predicting the elastic modulus of Tetra-PEG gel shifts from the phantom to affine network models with an increase in polymer concentration. The fracture energy is well predicted by the Lake-Thomas model. These experimental studies also suggest that Tetra-PEG gel has extremely homogeneous network structure and is a candidate material for evaluating the basic physical properties of polymer gels. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The I blocks had symmetrically once-inverted dipoles along the block contour, and their midpoint motion was dielectrically detected.

abstract = {In material science of elastomers the influence of nanoscale and nanostructured filler particles is of utmost significance for the performance of innovative rubber products, i.e., passenger car tires with ultralow rolling resistance but high wetgrip performance. A better understanding of the physical characteristics of the fillerrubber interface and the fillerrubber interphase as well is necessary to improve the overall macroscopic properties of these elastomeric nanocomposites. Therefore, the surface energies and polarities of filler particles with different modified surfaces were measured by a modified Wilhelmy technique. In all cases the rubber matrix consisted of a solution - styrene butadiene copolymers, filled with 20 or 40 phr pyrogenic or precipitated silica grades with different surface modifications by silanes, and a carbon black sample as reference. A moving die rheometer was employed to observe the filler flocculation at elevated temperatures (160 C) in rubber mixtures containing no curatives. A significant influence of the surface energy of the filler was noticed: the flocculation tendency increased with increasing difference in work of adhesion between filler and rubber. In dynamic mechanical measurements the influence of the filler/filler and the filler/polymer interactions were studied in cured S-SBR samples. Amplitude sweep experiments were carried out to investigate the temperature dependent nonlinear characteristics of the elastic and viscous moduli, which is commonly associated with a progressive breakdown of the filler network at higher strain amplitudes (Payne effect). Static measurements and relaxations test were accomplished by large scale strain experiments. A structuralphenomenological modeling of the long strain mechanical properties of these rubber compounds was done: the “layered fiber model”. This new model is based on the hypothesis that during deformation of the composites the polymer chains slipped off from the polymer interphase around the filler particles into the gaps between aggregates, where high-strength polymer fibers in an uniaxially oriented state are formed. We find new interesting correlations between the physicochemical properties of the filler/polymer interface and the macroscopic mechanical properties of the elastomeric materials.},

We report this type of dissipative mechanism for polymer gels for the first time. Assuming that the entire energy dissipated during the hysteresis cycle can be attributed to the fracture of network strands by a Lake?Thomas mechanism, our results suggest that the fracture and unloading of only 1{\%} of the bonds within the network leads to a decrease of up to 80{\%} of the number of strands. These results also demonstrate the very large degree of heterogeneity within the hydrogel network. If such a dissipative mechanism is active at the...},

abstract = {The author proposed the third concept in the reinforcement of elastomers for segmented polyurethane with the direct observation by microscopic techniques. The structure in segmented polyurethane elastomers fundamentally consists of three domains of different sizes, two kinds of micro-domain, cluster of 100 nm in diameter and spherulite of mu m order. Of the micro-domains, one is the hard-segment (HS)-rich micro-domain consisting of hard segment (4 nm thickness) and soft segment (7 nm) and the other is the hard-segment (HS)-poor micro-domain of hard segment (4 nm) and soft segment (15 similar to 20 nm). The HS cluster is constructed by the assembly of the HS-rich micro-domains. The spherulite seems to be composed of the dense packing of the HS cluster, growing up radially or circularly from the center to the outside surface. From physical and mechanical points of view, we can regard the above structures in the segmented polyurethane as bi-continuous structure of the HS clusters whose volume fraction is 0.2, and the matrix phase consisting of the HS-poor domains (0.8 in the volume fraction). The characteristic stress-strain relation of the segmented polyurethane is generated by the combination of both the continuous structures. That is, the initial very high stress (modulus) at small extension and the following gradual increase in stress at medium extension mainly result from the extension and the sliding of the HS cluster, respectively. The very large stress-upturn at large extension and the final great tensile strength are generated by the contribution of both the continuous structures. Thus, the third reinforcement is achieved by the formation of bicontinuous structure of the hard and strong cluster and also the strong matrix phase, in which the absolute structural defects seem not to be included.},

abstract = {Thermoreversible Hydrogen-bond crosslinking isoprene rubber (THC-IR) was synthesized by modification of isoprene rubber (IR) with maleic anhydride followed by the addition of 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole(ATA), in solid phase. The mechanical properties of the resulting rubber were more similar to the sulfur-vulcanized rubber than general thermoplastic elastomers (ex. SEBS). Although the tensile strength and elongation at break were lower than those of a corresponding sulfur-cured rubber, the moduli were as high as those of sulfur-cured rubber. Reforming could be repeated more than 10 times without significantly changing its mechanical properties. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that the superior mechanical properties and good recyclability are attributable to the strong hydrogen bonding. The TRC-IR showed an endothermic transition peak at around 185°C on the DSC chart, indicating cleavage of the hydrogen bonding. Moreover, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) clarified the crosslinking point is aggregated structure of ca. 5nm by supramolecular hydrogen bonding. A hypothetical model was suggested which comprises strong crosslinking moiety formed by the seven points hydrogen bonds. The thermoreversible crosslinking system could be applied to EPM and AEM, as well. These rubbers also showed superior mechanical properties as well as excellent recyclability.

The observed stress consequently is increased above predictions for the equivalent phantom network. On the plausible assumption that the dimensions of the domains are transformed linearly (affinely) by the macroscopic strain, the constraints become less restrictive in the direction of a principal extension $\lambda$t with increase in $\lambda$t. Hence, the relative enhancement of the stress diminishes with the strain.

abstract = {To assess the role of single-chain elasticity, non-affine strain fields and pre-stressed reference states we present and discuss the results of numerical and analytical analyses of a modified 8-chain Arruda-Boyce model for cross-linked polymer networks. This class of models has proved highly successful in modeling the finite-strain response of flexible rubbers. We extend it to include the effects of spatial disorder and the associated non-affinity, and use it to assess the validity of replacing the constituent chain's nonlinear elastic response with equivalent linear, Hookean springs. Surprisingly, we find that even in the regime of linear response, the full polymer model gives very different results from its linearized counterpart, even though none of the chains are stretched beyond their linear regime. We demonstrate that this effect is due to the fact that the polymer models are under considerable pre-stress in their ground state. We show that pre-stress strongly suppresses non-affinity in these unit cell models, resulting in a marked stiffening of the bulk response. Polymer networks with some degree of flexibility are thus intrinsically prestressed, and one effect of such prestresses is to reduce non-affine deformations. Combined, these findings may help explain why fully affine mechanical models, in many cases, predict the bulk mechanical response of disordered polymer networks so well.},

To demonstrate resistance to oxygen inhibition, thin polymer films of 3?15 ?m are polymerized while exposed to ambient air. Without photoinitiator molecules present, light is attenuated only by the monomer and polymer.

abstract = {The differential scanning calorimeter (Perkin-Elmer DSC-1) is used to characterize the cure of a general-purpose polyester during isothermal and scanning experiments. The technique is based on a new proposed model for the kinetics of isothermal cure. The model yields results which are in good agreement with experimental isothermal rate of reaction and integral heat of reaction data. It also gives some information about the residual reactivity of the sample after an isothermal cure experiment. With the aid of the proposed kinetic model, it is possible to obtain integral heats of reaction and rates of heat generation at different temperatures during a scanning experiment. The difference between the rate of heat input to the sample and the heat of reaction at any instant during scanning may be used to calculate the specific heat of the sample at the same instant. Specific heat data show two maxima during each scanning experiment. These maxima may be associated with transitions occurring during cure in the melt and rubbery states.},

We introduce the affine length R-aff, which separates the solid-like elastic deformations on larger scales from liquid-like nonaffine deformations on smaller scales. This affine length grows with elongation lambda as R-aff similar to lambda (3/2) and decreases upon compression as R-aff similar to lambda(1/2). The behavior of networks on scales up to R-aff is that of stretched or compressed individual chains (we call them affine strands). The affine strands are stretched in the elongation direction and confined and folded in the effective tubes in the compression direction. The fluctuations of affine strands determine the diameters of the confining tubes alpha, which change nonaffinely with the network deformation alpha similar to lambda(1/2). Our model gives a unified picture of deformations of both phantom and entangled networks and leads to a stress-strain relation that is in excellent agreement with experiments.},

Results are largely formal, save for the explicit demonstration that the formation of a perfect network results in chain shrinkage by a factor of 2 for perfect networks, as was shown by James. Graph theory is exploited to formulate the partition function for the perfect network, and by its means we show that the connectivity of the tetrafunctional network composed of g chains can be defined in all details by speci- fication of a (p - 1)-dimensional vector whose elements are the lengths of fundamental circuits. The calculation of the charac- teristic function for the radius of gyration of the network is carried to the penultimate stage; a later paper will deal with its evaluation. Two methods are used to solve the problem; the first considers the network as it exists, while in the second the formation of the network is stressed.},

Test methods used in the 1990s are referenced, such as hydroxyl number, polymer molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution. Health and safety factors are discussed, as well as the economic aspects of PTMEG production. Most important uses of PTMEG are in elastomeric polyurethanes and polyesters. The same type of information is given for oxetane polymers, although no oxetane polymer has found any practical application and is thus not available commercially as of 1995.},

abstract = {Tensile fatigue failure of a gum vulcanizate of noncrystallizing SBR can be accounted for by the growth of small flaws initially present in the rubber. Fatigue of crystallizing natural rubber was shown in Part I to be attributable to the same cause. Cut growth results are interpreted in terms of the tearing energy theory of Rivlin and Thomas. SBR exhibits cut growth under both static and dynamic conditions; in each case the rate is approximately proportional to the fourth power of the tearing energy. Variation of the dynamic cut growth rate with frequency can be explained by the summation of a timedependent static component of growth and a cyclic component not dissimilar to that occurring in natural rubber. Fatigue failure, under both static and dynamic conditions, is predicted from the cut growth results. These predictions are found to account quantitatively for experimentally observed fatigue lives when a suitable value is assumed for the initial flaw size. Fatigue lives at different temperatures correlate well with cut growth results obtained by Greensmith and Thomas over the same temperature range. The results are compared to those obtained previously for natural rubber, and possible reasons for the differences in fatigue behavior of crystallizing and noncrystallizing rubbers are discussed.},

For a given polymer and cure system, this paper discusses the impact of the filler network, both its strength and architecture, on the dynamic modulus and hysteresis during dynamic strain. It was found that the filler network can substantially increase the effective volume of the filler due to rubber trapped in the agglomerates, leading to high elastic modulus. The amount of trapped rubber was estimated according to Van der Poel theory. During cyclic strain, while the stable filler network can reduce the hysteresis of the filled rubber, the breakdown and reformation of the filler network would cause an additional energy dissipation resulting in higher hysteresis.},

The model was applied to a semi-crystalline polyamide polymer, PA66. The experiments included tension and shear testing coupled with synchronized digital image correlation and infrared measurements device for capturing the time, temperature, and stress state dependence, as well as the complex thermomechanical coupling exhibited by the material under large deformation. A notion of equivalent strain rate (based on the time-temperature principle superposition) was also introduced to show its capability to build master curves and therefore decrease the number of testing needed to build a material database. The model is based on the Edward Vilgis theory (1986) and accounts for chains network reorganization under external loading through the introduction of an evolution equation for the internal state variable, $\eta$￣, representing the degree of mobility of entanglement points. The model accounting for the equivalent strain rate notion was calibrated using master curves. The thermomechanical model agreed well with the experimental mechanical and temperature measurements under tension and shear conditions. The approach developed in this study may open a different way to model the polymer behavior.},

abstract = {Recent rubber elasticity theory, according to which departures from relationships derived for phantom networks originate in constraints on the fluctuations of network junctions, is applied to the treatment of strain birefringence. The strain birefringence of phantom networks is first considered. It is smaller than for networks in which the transformation of chain vectors is affine in the macroscopic strain, as assumed in all previous treatments of strain birefringence in rubber elastic systems. The relationship of birefringence to the stress is the same, however. Real networks, in which the constraints on fluctuations impart a pattern of behavior intermediate between the extremes of phantom and affme networks, are treated in detail by extension of rubber elasticity theory. Illustrative numerical calculations are presented. Contributions of the constraints to the birefringence An are somewhat larger, relatively, than their contributions to the stress 7. In contrast to theories of phantom and of affine networks, An for the real network is predicted to be nonlinear with 7 for uniaxial extension; i.e., the stress-optical coefficient An/r should decrease with elongation.},

abstract = {The 1D limit of a 3D visco-hyperelastic model is discussed and validated using a rich and rigor- ous database obtained on PMMA above Tg. Inelastic phe- nomena are accounted for as an evolution of internal variables assumed to be related to the alteration of micro- structure that induces changes in well chosen constitutive parameters and dissipation of energy. Inelastic strain-rate is deduced from energy balance between elastic and dissi- pative phenomenon. The concept allows introducing time effects in any rubber elasticity theory, resulting in a visco- hyperelastic model consistent with continuum thermody- namics. In this article, Edwards-Vilgis' model is used as the core and extended to a general time dependent consti- tutive model. Phenomenological models for disentangle- mentment or crystallization are suggested that allow reproducing all viscoelastic effects using one unique model. An accounting for temperature and strain-rate effects by an ‘‘a priori'' uses of time temperature superpo- sition principle is also proposed. The three concepts result in an original model of high efficiency. This new approach is a highly attractive way of modeling time dependent behavior of polymers over a wide range of temperature and strain-rate up to large strains.

As in an earlier analysis of the equilibrium elasticity of networks, the calculations were performed in two steps. The spectrum for an ensemble of arbitrarily large sample networks with peripheral junctions anchored at their most probable distribution of locations was obtained, then the contribution associated with elements far removed from the peripheral junctions was extracted. The resulting spectrum is continuous and becomes narrower with increasing functionality. The maximum relaxation time is To/(l - 2(F - l)'''/F) in which T{\~{}} is the primary relaxation time of unattached strands. Thus, even in the most extreme case of trifunctional junctions (F = 31, the longest relaxation time is smaller than 20{\~{}}{\~{}}, indicating the need to consider additional structural features, such as dangling strands and entanglements, to account for the much broader relaxation spectra of real networks.},

abstract = {It is well-known that mechanical properties of gels are strongly related to inhomogeneities of gels such as spatial and connectivity inhomogeneities (defects and variation of cycles). Here, a cycle is defined as the type of polygonal shape formed by several prepolymers. However, these inhomogeneities, especially connectivity inhomogeneities, have hardly been quantified due to the difficulty in directly observing them. To directly observe and analyze gel structures, we used a molecular dynamics simulation to reproduce gelation process and quantified defects and cycles of the obtained gels. Furthermore, we investigated the relation between defects or cycles and spatial inhomogeneities. Our investigation indicated that defects caused spatial inhomogeneities in dilute and semidilute systems. On the other hand, in concentrated systems, self-biting links, in which a cross-link connects with itself, caused spatial inhomogeneities. This could be observed in the swollen state, which is revealed in the difference in degree of swelling of cycles during the swelling process. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We have investigated the fracture behaviors of tetra-arm polyethylene glycol (Tetra-PEG) gels with controlled network structures. Tetra-PEG gels were prepared by AB-type crosslink-coupling of mutually reactive tetra-arm prepolymers with different concentrations and molecular weights. This series of controlled network structures, for the first time, enabled us to quantitatively examine the Lake-Thomas model, which is the most popular model predicting fracture energies of elastomers. The experimental data showed good agreement with the Lake-Thomas model, and indicated a new molecular interpretation for the displacement length (L), the area around a crack tip within which the network strands are fully stretched. L corresponded to the three times of end-to-end distance of network strands, regardless of all parameters examined. We conclude that the Lake-Thomas model can quantitatively predict the fracture energy of polymer network without trapped entanglements, with the enhancement factor being near 3.},

abstract = {Non-isothermal heating rate kinetics was applied to two epoxy resin systems. In situ near-infrared (NIR) measurements were taken with a heatable NIR cell which allowed the cure to be monitored by characteristic absorption bands. An autocatalyzed reaction of the nth order was shown to describe the epoxy conversion curves. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used as a complementary method. The kinetic models developed by both NIR and DSC are in good accordance with experimental epoxy conversion in the in situ NIR setup for single and multiple cure temperature ramps. A linear calibration curve of the characteristic absorption bands of epoxy normalized to aromatic vibrations was introduced. The curing degree of structural epoxies that were cured according to an industrial temperature cure profile was determined by NIR using the calibration curve. The epoxy conversions of the structural components showed good agreement with the experimental in situ NIR. Several degrees of cure for structural specimens were evaluated by NIR and residual reaction enthalpy by DSC. We present the non-destructive NIR spectroscopy as an alternative to determine fast and non-destructive epoxy conversion, particularly suitable for high degrees of cure on structural components.},

abstract = {Polymer gels formed from A-B type of coupling reaction were investigated vigorously as a "model network" because the mesh size of the network was defined by the size and shape of the building blocks. However, the formation of these networks has an inherent difficulty in homogeneous mixing of mutually reactive building blocks, leading to the formation of inhomogeneous network structures. Recently, we have designed and fabricated the Tetra-PEG gel by combining two well-defined symmetrical tetra-arm polymers of the same size. Although this gel was formed by simply mixing two polymer solutions, the structure was extremely homogeneous. In this study, we investigated the gelation kinetics of Tetra-PEG gel in detail. The reaction kinetics corresponded well with the theoretical prediction, suggesting the homogeneous reacting system. This homogeneous reacting system may contribute to the homogeneous network structure of Tetra-PEG gel.},

The ?m-dependence of the elastic modulus exhibits a crossover at ?c due to large contraction of the network strands (supercoiling) accompanying deswelling. The Obukhov model successfully describes the ?m-dependence of the elastic modulus. We estimate the fractal dimension of network strands (Df) by analyzing the stress-elongation relationships at high stretching using Pincus blob concept. In the supercoiling region, Df increases with an increase in ?m, which suggests that the gyration radius of network strands decreases with deswelling in affine manner. The extensibility increases with an increase in ?m because the deswelling reduces the distance between the neighboring junctions. These findings will help to understand the structure and formation mechanism of supercoiling.},

From the consideration of familiar properties of rubber, it is concluded that in the lightly vulcanized state it consists of a coherent network of flexible molecular chains (this involving a considerable fraction of the total material) together with other molecules not actively involved in the network, but acting like a fluid mass through which the network extends and in which it moves with Brownian motion.

Ferner wird die optische Anisotropie eines derartigen Einzelfadens, dessen Anfangs- und Endpunkt festgehalten wird, in Abhngigkeit von diesem Abstande h sowie in Abhngigkeit von der Anisotropie des einzelnen statistischen Fadenelementes festgestellt. Bei Substanzen, die aus solchen Fadenmoleklen aufgebaut sind, wird sowohl die beim Dehnen auftretende mechanische Rckstellkraft als auch die optische Anisotropie einesteils auf eine beim Dehnen erfolgende teilweise Orientierung der Vektoren h , andernteils auf eine Lngennderung der Vektoren h beim Dehnen zurckgefhrt. Der relative Anteil, mit dem die Orientierung der Vektoren h einerseits, die Lngennderung der Vektoren h andererseits am Gesamteffekt beteiligt ist, ist verschieden, wenn wir das eine Mal die Dehnungsdoppelbrechung, das andere Mal die elastische Rckstellkraft betrachten. In bereinstimmung mit aus der Literatur entnommenen experimentellen Befunden zeigt sich, da das Verhltnis der optischen Doppelbrechung n ∥ -? n ⊥ zu der diese erzeugenden dehnenden Kraft (in dyn/cm 2 ) von der Kettengliederzahl Z der die Substanz aufbauenden Fadenmolekle (Vulkanisationsgrad im Falle von Kautschuk) unabhngig ist. Zum Schlusse werden die kinetischen Vorstellungen, welche zur Deutung der mechanischen Rckstellkraft kautschukhnlicher Stoffe vorgeschlagen wurden, diskutiert. Es wird dabei auf den statistisch-wahrscheinlichkeitsmigen Charakter der elastischen Rckstellkraft hingewiesen im Gegensatz zu Anstzen, nach denen diese Kraft durch ungleiche Verteilung der mittleren kinetischen Energie auf die den Fadenteilen zur Verfgung stehenden Freiheitsgrade erklrt werden sollte.},

Covalent and reversible noncovalent interactions are two basic cross-linking forces to form three- dimensional networks in polymer gels. The networks based on covalent bonds in chemical gels are stable under ambient conditions owing to their robust and irreversible natures of the covalent bonds. Dynamic covalent chemistry offers an appealing prospect of constructing such materials. The chemical gel possesses self-healing property based on the reversible breaking and regenerating of acylhydrazone bonds. The dynamic polymer gels formed as well in other solvents such as ethanol, DMSO and CH 2Cl2. These gels were covalent cross-linked and revealed typical properties of chemical gels. The present discovery indicates that dynamic polymer gels may have a broad application as smart soft materials.},

This network, the Tetra network, is made by cross-end-coupling of tetra-arm polymer modules. The mechanical energy dissipation was extremely low (tan $\delta$ ? 10(-4) ). The macroscopic stress-strain relationship of the Tetra network was in good agreement with that of microscopic elastic blobs. The maximum breaking strength was extremely high (?27 MPa). These results indicate that the Tetra network is closer to an ideal polymer network than any other conventional model networks. Because the Tetra network can be treated as uniformly packed elastic blobs, it should help apply the knowledge of single polymer chains seamlessly to the design of polymer materials and help further develop the theory of rubber elasticity.},

The rubber/filler interactions were controlled by the modification of silica surface using several kinds of silane coupling agents. Information on the chain scission was obtained by the electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. The combination of ESR results and stress-strain data revealed that, at a given strain, the tensile stress increased with increasing the interfacial interactions between rubber molecules and silica surface, and simultaneously the chain scission became remarkable. Further, the degree of chain scission was closely related to the mechanical energy applied to the vulcanizates. The cyclic tests of stress-strain measurements suggested that the chain scissions contributed to the Mullins effect. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

There has been considerable discussion in the literature about which of two crite- ria, the Flory or the Scanlan-Case, should be used for counting the number of strands and junctions. Although each method leads to different values for Y and p, it is demonstrated that the difference, Y - p, is the same regardless of the criterion used.

@article{Javdanitehran2016,
abstract = {In this work a novel iterative method for isothermal cure kinetic modelling of an epoxy resin system using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique is presented. To reach the isothermal cure temperature, the sample has to be heated up from ambient temperature. This is commonly done with very high heat-up rates to minimise the time the sample reacts at temperatures other than the desired one. However, during heat up with high heating the amount of released energy rates cannot be measured directly because the shape of baseline is unknown. This means that the cure state at the beginning of the isothermal stage is unknown. For fast curing systems this unknown cure state causes significant inaccuracies in cure kinetics modelling. The presented iterative approach attempts to estimate the released enthalpy during heat-up of an isothermal run through an iterative numerical modelling of the heat-up phase. In each iteration the algorithm starts by estimating the enthalpy released during heat-up based on the recorded temperature profile and the calibrated model of the previous iteration. At the same time, it estimates the degree of cure at the end of the heat-up phase. Once the initial cure state is known the total heat of enthalpy can be recalculated for the current iteration. Subsequently the degree of cure and curing rate are re-evaluated with the newly estimated total enthalpy and used for determining the kinetics parameters. This is done by simultaneous fitting of the selected model to all experimental heat flow curves using a non-linear non-restricted multivariable fitting method. The model with these new parameters is used again to estimate the released enthalpy and cure degree during the heat-up phase. The described loop is repeated until a predefined convergence criterion is satisfied. For modelling the reaction kinetics, the Kamal?Sourour equation accompanied with Rabinowitch approach to consider the diffusion effects is used. The diffusion reaction rate is modelled by the free volume model proposed by Huguenin and Klein. DiBenedetto model is applied to predict the evolution of glass transition temperature against the degree of cure. In order to compensate the effect of the initial values in the model's calibration, the algorithm is implemented in a routine, which assesses the quality of the fitting and consequently selects the cure kinetics parameter. The described algorithm and the routine are implemented in MATLAB. This paper demonstrates the application of this approach for using cure kinetics modelling to predict the degree of cure and the glass transition temperature. It supports the obtained results with validation tests using isothermal, dynamic and combined temperature profiles.},

The tensile strength and ultimate strain at the various strain rates and temperatures were superposed to give two composite curves which are functions of a reduced strain rate. From this superposition, the temperature dependence of the ultimate, properties was obtained. The temperature dependence between ?53.8 and 71° is essentially the same as obtained by superposing the stress‐strain curves and is given by the Williams, Landel, and Ferry equation. From the composite curves and the temperature function, the tensile strength and the ultimate strain can be predicted at any strain rate and temperature, provided heating and wave propagation effects are negligible. The linear viscoelastic properties were obtained from the initial portions of stress‐strain curves and are represented by a reduced stress‐strain curve. },

abstract = {In the cationic ring-opening polymerization of cyclic ethers, three major factors, i.e. ring strain, basicity and steric hindrance, are known to govern the reactivity. Considering from these three factors, cycloaliphatic epoxides seem to be the best candidate for the high performance formulations. In the commercial applications, 3,4-epoxycyclohexyl-3′,4′-epoxycyclohexene-carboxylate (ECC) is widely used as cycloaliphatic epoxy monomer. In ECC polymerization, the possibility of ester group participation was pointed out, which resulted in lower reactivity. The negative effect of ester group seems to be very important issue for improved reactivity. In this study, to clarify the effect of the ester group on the cationic polymerization, two di-functional monomers, 2,2-bis-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)-propane (CADE-1) and 3,3′-bicyclohexene-3,3′,4,4′-diepoxide (CADE-2), were selected as candidate for no-ester monomers and their reactivity in the photo-initiated cationic polymerization was investigated. Using photo-DSC and real time DRA method, reactivity comparison of them with ECC was conducted. High curing rate of CADEs, especially for low viscous CADE-2, was confirmed. The curing rate of highly viscous CADE-1 was effectively accelerated by addition of low viscous oxetane monomer.},
